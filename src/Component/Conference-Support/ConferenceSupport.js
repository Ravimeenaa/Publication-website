          International Journal of Advanced Technology and Science Research
          (IJATSR) is presently looking for opportunities to cooperate with
          conference organisers across the globe to publish the conference
          proceedings separately or as addition issue in IJATSR. It is a recent
          development and new addition in our service, after thoroughly
          analysing the need and demand we had decided to support few academic
          conferences conducted by various organisations and associations. It is
          well known fact in the recent days bountiful conferences were being
          conducted and most of them end up with publishing their conference
          proceedings as hard copy or in the digital media which is not widely
          circulated. This restricts the ideas and views shared in the
          conferences, the ideas being discussed and analysed by very few
          attending the conference and to those who receive the proceedings.
          Only few conferences publish their proceedings in online media, we
          would like to support the organisations who are interested to publish
          their proceedings through us.
